Generate 15 high-quality search queries for arXiv (https://arxiv.org/search) based on the scientific article about {тема статьи}. Each query should be optimized for finding relevant academic papers.

Requirements:
- All queries in English, web-safe format (no special operators except quotes for exact phrases)
- Focus on core concepts: {основные концепции}
- Include relevant anchor terms: method, algorithm, model, system, analysis, dataset
- Provide 3 types of queries for each of 5 thematic clusters:

Thematic clusters:
1. {кластер 1}
2. {кластер 2}
3. {кластер 3}
4. {кластер 4}
5. {кластер 5}

For each cluster, generate:
- Precise query: 2-4 specific keywords with 1 anchor term
- Balanced query: short phrase in quotes (2-3 words) + 1-2 related keywords
- Exploratory query: broader terms to discover related work

Format: List queries by cluster, clearly marking the type of each query.
Ensure diversity and avoid duplicates across all queries.
